Imgurkin
========
A super simple imgur client for the Kindle experimental browser. Currently allows for browsing the Imgur gallery 'hot' section. The name for this project was brainchild of an attempt to fuze together the names 'Imgur' and 'Kindle'. After coming across this combination, we found it too funny to give up.

How to use
----------
> Note: Currently only the `gallery.php` is really usable. Other pages will be made to work soon.

When the gallery is first launched, Imgurkin goes and grabs a cache of the latest images available on imgur. Because of how much traffic Imgur recieves, new images are bound to appear. To get these new images, click on the `Rebuild Cache` button at the bottom of the page. To navigate forwards through images, press the `Next` button. To navigate back through images, press the `Prev` button. To get the latest 

Key shortcuts `n` and `p` are also available for browsing backwards and forwards more quickly.
